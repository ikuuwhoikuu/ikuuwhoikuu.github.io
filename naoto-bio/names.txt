By used of the relational space we are imposing ourselves, we take it and use it for our own purposes.
We cannot avoid it if we want to explore the relationship, if we wanna be contaminated.
Give time to yourself, sit, walk around and look, listen, wait.
There is nothing spectacular, who is waiting for you, there is just life in its most simple form.
Observe it and care for it.
This project wants to give us a moment to reflect on who we are as humans, and how we want to relate in this fictional-real web of lives.
As someone else once said: caring means being contaminated.
This is our wish for you from us.
Naoto Hieda is an artist from Japan, currently based in Montreal, Canada.
I am not interested in creating new ideas or pieces as a conventional art form; instead, my approach is to reveal intrinsic aspects of things since I cannot associate labels or words linguistically or metaphorically to a certain topic that I want to manifest.
This is my motivation to switch my career from a media artist or an engineer who creates and generates new form of tangible representations into a conceptual artist tackling with topics in neuroscience or neurotechnology with help of visual art, media art and contemporary dance to learn and reveal things that we perceive in a daily life.
